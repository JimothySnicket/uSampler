# Found: open-unmix-js Repository!

## Discovery

The search found: **https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-js**

This is a **web-based audio unmixing tool** - exactly what we need!

## What This Means

This repository likely contains:
- ✅ Pre-converted TensorFlow.js models
- ✅ JavaScript implementation
- ✅ Working browser-based separation
- ✅ Model files ready to use

## Next Steps

1. **Check the repository** for:
   - Model files (model.json, weights.bin)
   - How they're structured
   - Where models are hosted

2. **Download models** if available:
   - May be in the repo
   - Or hosted on CDN
   - Or in releases

3. **Use their implementation** as reference:
   - See how they load models
   - See preprocessing/postprocessing
   - Adapt to our code

## This Could Be The Solution!

Instead of converting ourselves, we might be able to:
- Use their pre-converted models
- Or clone their approach
- Or fork their code

Let's check it out!
