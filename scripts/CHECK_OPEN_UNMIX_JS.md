# Checking open-unmix-js Repository

## Found Reference

The search mentioned **open-unmix-js** - a web-based implementation!

## What We Need to Check

1. **Repository URL**: https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-js
2. **Does it have**:
   - Pre-converted TensorFlow.js models?
   - Model files we can download?
   - Conversion scripts?
   - Working implementation we can reference?

## Next Action

We should:
1. Check the repository directly
2. Look for model files
3. See if models are in releases or main branch
4. Check how they load/use models

This could be our shortcut to getting working models!

## Current Status

- ✅ Models downloaded (PyTorch format)
- ✅ Conversion pipeline partially working
- ⏳ Need to either:
  - Fix dependency versions and complete conversion
  - OR find pre-converted models (like in open-unmix-js)

Let's check the open-unmix-js repo!
